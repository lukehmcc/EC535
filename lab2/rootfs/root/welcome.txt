Welcome to the EC535 Stock Image v1.0!

The stock package includes a working kernel image, rootfs.img, 
and rootfs source directory (in stock-rootfs.tar.gz). The rootfs
has been preloaded with a precompiled version of busybox. The 
kernel and the busybox binaries provided in this package were
configured with the goal of balancing size and usability.

You may use this stock image for assignments where configuring
the kernel, the rootfs, and/or busybox are NOT part of the main
goals. If you have any questions, please contact your
instructor or a TA.

Have fun!
